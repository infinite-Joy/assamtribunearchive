# Assam Tribune Archive v0.1

The [Assam Tribune](http://assamtribune.com) is the largest English language daily of North-East India. But the website is prehistoric with no proper archival system.

v0.1 script scrapes images of Assam Tribune daily and converts in into a single PDF for archival.

Very crude code. Patches are welcome. 

# To be implemented in the future if time permits

* Optimize the file size of the PDF
* Integration with mailchimp for daily inbox delivery
* Parallelization of downloading images
* Downloading old editions of the paper
* OCR the images for a search database
